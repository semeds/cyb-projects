# Cyber Projects

This repository is for my personal projects related to Cybersecurity and IT. I'm doing these projects mainly to improve my knowledge and understanding of various processes and concepts. 

Here you will be able to navigate to the various projects within the repo, instead of having to scroll through. The links take you directly to the documentation for each project.

I plan to include the errors I faced and the steps I took to troubleshoot each problem. They will be included in either the main documentation, or in a separate document
